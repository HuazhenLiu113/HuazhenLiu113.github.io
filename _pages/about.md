<br/>
Currently, I am a first year PhD student at UNC Chapel Hill, advised by professor [Praneeth Chakravarthula](https://www.cs.unc.edu/~cpk/). I've received my Master degree majoring in Electronic and Information Engineering at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University(SJTU)](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn), where I worked with professor [Yuan Qu](https://ssse.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/Info/413) and professor [Jiamiao Yang](https://ssse.sjtu.edu.cn/Data/Info/474) in [IPSI](https://juopt.sjtu.edu.cn/). Before that, I've obtained the Bachelor's degree in Electronic Engineering from [Tianjin University](https://www.tju.edu.cn/).

<br/>
I have some experience in both diffractive neural network and wavefront shaping, while currently I am interested in computational optics, specifically computational imaging. 

<br/>

Please feel free to contact me at [lianhy0@cs.unc.edu](lianhy0@cs.unc.edu) for any communications related to the computational optics or anything else that I can help with.
